\subsection{GRBL software}

GRBL is an open source software that runs on an arduino.
It accepts commands over the serial port and controlls the stepper motors.

See documentation: \url{https://github.com/grbl/grbl}

\subsection{Custom G200}

We modified grbl to accept a new G200 command.
When the controller receives a G200 command, it responds
with \$G200=... where ... is the amount of commands in the
buffer (that is received commands that are not executed yet).
This way, our controller knows where in the execution the arduino
currently is.

\subsection{M105}
