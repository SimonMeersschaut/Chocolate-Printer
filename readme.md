# Chocolate Printer

## About

This project aims at modifying a 3D printer to make chocolate sculptures.
To achieve this both hardware and software had to be modified.
This repository provides all information necessary to recreate this yourself.

## Documentation

For extensive documentation, please refer to the pdf file `documentation/main.pdf`. We chose not to include this file in the source code, so you will have to compile the pdf yourself.
